<h1 align="center"> Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Im Joel Garcia! </h1>

I'm a UPC Freshman in Aerospace Engineering from Spain who is interested in physics, aerodynamics, some abstract math and computers. I am studying aerospace engineering because I love bringing to life new inventions and combining math, physics and coding together to create something new and I am fascinated by rockets and airplanes. I am currently working with the MIT in different projects and working in some personal projects you can follow in my socials. 


## Coding Projects

### [[MIT EDW 2021] Shaking Hands Overseas](https://github.com/Shaking-Hands-Overseas)

In this project we 3D printed a Human hand and built LucasVR's glove which allowed us to move the hand from around the world. I've linked the Organization Page, from where you can access every component of the project.

### [[MIT EDW 2022] Foot Piano](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/Foot-Piano)

This is the code behind my EDW's 2022 Project, In which we created a foot piano with buttons and ultrasonic sensors.

### [[CS50x 2022] Musical Recorder](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/Musical-Recorder)

This is the code behind my EDW's 2022 Project, In which we created a foot piano with buttons and ultrasonic sensors.

### [Online TicTacToe](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/TicTacToe)

In This Project I created a TicTac Toe GUI with Pygame and using an Express Server hosted with heroku I made this game Online

### [Discord Bot](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/Paralelogramos_Bot)

I Created this Bot in 2020 for my discord server, but since discord.py was discontinued I changed to discord.js and made public the Source Code of the old bot.

### [My Website's Code](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/newtoniano20.github.io)

For over two years now I've mantained my own website, which was built with angular from scratch. It started as a Project to learn about HTML and Javascript and it has finished as it is.

### [Background Image Changer depending on Weather](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/Background-Weather)

The Aim of this app was to allow me to change my background image depending on the real weather in any part of the world.

### [Simple Guess The Word Game](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/Guess-The-Word)

This is a simple recreation of the typical Guess the word game with an editable list.

### [Python App for Rocket Simulations](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/Coeteria)

I created this App to allow me to simulate rocket's trajectory using simple physics
### [Simple Mincraft Plugins](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/Minecraft-Plugins)

As I've always loved mincraft, I tried coding a simple Plugin to get started, I'll develop more complex ones as time goes on.

### [Wordle](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/Wordle)

With the increasing popularity of Wordle I tried to find the best starting word. This is my attempt on it.

### [Geometry Dash Clone Game made with Unity](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/-Unity--Geometry-Dash-Clone)

To learn game development I challenged myself to learn Unity in one day. This is what I was able to do.

### [Telegraph App](https://github.com/Newtoniano20/Telegraph-App)

At MIT Edgerton Center I learnt about the telegraph and how to transmit data through encoding with it, so I was motivated to create this app to create a telegraph as a mobile app.
